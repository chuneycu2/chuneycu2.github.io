      <p>Participate (formerly VIF International Education) tasked me with the redesign of the company’s exchange teacher application form, an application in SurveyGizmo made for educators from around the world to apply for a J 1 visa to teach in American classrooms.</p>
      <p>The form itself is the linchpin of Participate’s exchange teacher program, which has been the core of the company’s business model for nearly 30 years. The production of a new form was the largest project I have managed in my time with Participate, and it took over six months in first half of 2018 to complete.</p>
    <h2>Seamless experience</h2>
      <p>The form needed to be redesigned for two main reasons. One, the company rebranded in 2017, and its assets needed to reflect the style guide of the new brand. Two, the application experience needed to be unified. Up until the redesign, the form had consisted of three parts: a registration that determined a candidate’s qualifications; a review process with the recruitment team; and a formal registration to which qualified candidates would then be invited to apply.</p>

      <p>The new design replaced the manual review in step 2 with logic that would allow an applicant to learn whether they were qualified immediately, without having to wait for a review and potentially lose interest.</p>

    <img class="hero flow-mobile" src="./resources/images/application-flow-new-mobile-01.png" alt="Improvements between form designs accounting for flow and user fatigue" />
      <p>My job was to build a new form that incorporated this change along with a brand new set of custom styles that aligned with the company brand.</p>
    <h2>Production</h2>
      <p>Building the form to spec in SurveyGizmo was a challenge because I had to write a custom stylesheet from scratch to reflect the prototype. This stylesheet needed to not only reflect new branding guidelines, it also needed to play nice with SurveyGizmo’s framework. This required some creativity with classes and selectors that gave me a lot of new experience writing CSS.</p>

    <div class="notation">
      <p>Flexbox and custom classes for dropdown menus helped arrange cluttered page elements</p>
    </div>
      <p>The existing form was visually clunky and packed a lot of questions onto certain pages. It took some experimentation to reposition page elements in a way that made sense while managing potential user fatigue. An educator interested in a teaching position in a country far away from home needed to feel good about their application experience, or they might decide not to make such a life-changing career move.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Early on I made the assumption that SurveyGizmo IDs would serve as reliable selectors, so I targeted them often to apply styles to specific elements. This worked at first - but as we progressively enhanced the form by tweaking logic and adding/removing pages, I realized that my stylesheet was breaking! I learned that while IDs on a web document are always unique, this does not mean they are constant.</p>
      <p>This error on my part provided the opportunity to write more sustainable class declarations that control page elements regardless of their externally-assigned IDs. I refactored my entire stylesheet, eliminating over 500 lines of unnecessary code in the process.</p>

    <div class="notation">
      <p>Cleaning up my stylesheet also gave me the chance to write annotations for future developers</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>After about two months of testing and tweaking, the form was fully synced with SalesForce and ready for deployment. We launched the new application in October 2018, and results were already coming in by the end of the month.</p>

    <div class="notation">
      <p>Recruitment season for 2019-2020 began in October 2018, when we launched the new application. By November 2018, we had over 100% more applications accepted than we did at the same time in 2017.</p>
    </div>
      <p>Metric-driven marketing and a dedicated team effort led to these massive improvements at the top of the marketing funnel, where the new application's performance showed immediate results. With the process streamlined for automatic qualification, the recruitment team had access to many more interested candidates than in previous years.</p>
