        <p>Instaclustr is a database management company that ensures scalable, reliable data delivery and seamless integration between open source technologies. I worked to rebuild and rebrand Instaclustr's main domain for improved performance and SEO, brand alignment with NetApp, and generative engine optimization in the growing era of AI.</p>

        <h2>Netapp brand alignment</h2>
        <p>As part of an acquisition by NetApp, the site was built on a dated theme that was inflexible and poorly optimized. Before redesigning the front end, I set up a development pipeline to utilize a CSS preprocessor and other automation tools through Gulp.js, enabling me to rapidly develop styling and templating for the new theme.</p>

            <p>The old Instaclustr theme (left) and the new rebranded theme I built (right)</p>
        </div>
        <p>I collaborated with an in-house design team to review mockups and provide developer feedback that would ensure new features were scalable and on-brand. I used the full design specs they delivered to scope and build components with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) in a new child theme.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>New features</h2>
        <p>Instaclustr has a robust pricing API with node costs across data centers and regions. I accessed this API with RESTful principles so that I could program an optimized pricing page that would quickly and safely serve results to users.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="notation">
            <p>The previous build copied all the API's JSON into HTML on page load, creating markup that was megabytes in weight. I wrote scripts to handle API data properly for better performance.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Instaclustr.com features a documentation area that is managed by an internal developer relations team. I worked with this team during the rebrand to accommodate their feedback and ensure that their detailed work was accessible and easy to navigate within a nested sidebar menu.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Speed and performance</h2>
        <p>Prior to my work on the site, instaclustr.com was poorly-optimized and had never passed Google's Core Web Vitals. As part of the rebrand, I implemented features across the codebase that improved average page load speeds from 6-7s to 1-2s, achieving passing scores for the best rankings boost in Google's algorithm.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Generative search optimization (GEO)</h2>
        <p>I worked closely with an SEO agency to optimize content across the site for LLM consumption, improving visibility across popular AI tools and boosting traffic. With site performance as a foundation, I published 10-15 keyword-focused education guides a month that tripled AI engine engagement on our site in 2025.</p>

        <div class="notation">
            <p>The template I built for education guides is optimized for LLM consumption.</p>
        </div>
        <p>While user behaviors are changing as AI tools evolve, the lightweight theme I built enabled me to quickly adapt to algorithm updates and capitalize on new trends. My work in collaboration with the team produced clear results:</p>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 32px;">
            <li>We increased organic traffic by 22% in a quarter by adapting quickly to Google's core update in June 2025</li>
            <li>We achieved 50% visibility in Google's AI mode in Q3 (twice that of Amazon in October 2025)</li>
            <li>Instaclustr's education center traffic increased by 10x overall in 2025</li>
