      <h1>Wordpress sites</h1>
      <h4>Wordpress, CSS, Responsive design</h4>
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="content-container center">
    <p>Wordpress powers <a href="https://digital.com/blog/wordpress-stats/" target="_blank">more than a quarter</a> of all websites on the internet, making it the most widely-used content management system available on the web today.</p>
    <p>I have worked extensively with Wordpress websites and have a strong understanding of plugins, theme editing and the dashboard. Below are two of the largest Wordpress instances I have managed in my time as a designer and producer.</p>

    <!-- Tabs -->

      <div class="tab">
        <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'Participate')" id="defaultOpen">Participate</button>
        <button class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'VIF')">VIF International Education</button>
      </div>

    <!-- Tab content -->

      <div id="Participate" class="tabcontent">
        <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/wordpress/wordpress-participate-overview-01.png" alt="Desktop and mobile views of participate.com / participatelearning.com" />
        <p>VIF International Education rebranded in 2017 to Participate, and the company’s brand took a modern turn into a focus on vector art and education technology. I worked within a parent theme to create the site’s pages and navigation structure alongside Participate’s digital marketing manager.</p>
        <h2>Teacher needs</h2>
        <p>Participate's new brand was the result of a company acquisition that became a new product focus, and eventually a new website and sibling company of its own. As a result, the new site we needed to build did not differ in content from what had previously existed on vifprogram.com. This gave us the opportunity to recalibrate our approach to the exchange teacher program and focus on deep dive pages that fleshed out the program more thoroughly for interested educators.</p>
        <div class="img-row">
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-positions-01.png" alt="participate.com teacher positions page" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-locations-01.png" alt="participate.com school locations pages" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="notation">
          <p>Research into user experience on our previous site gave us the info we needed to build more detailed information for prospective teachers in the program</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Navigating builders</h2>
        <p>As with a lot of Wordpress themes, the freedom to design quickly comes at the cost of page builders and WYSIWYG editors. I was able to use my front-end experience to tailor my approach to certain page layouts and achieve desired designs without help from external developers.</p>
        <div class="img-row">
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-careers-code-01.png" alt="participate.com career page editing" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-careers-01.png" alt="participate.com careers page two column" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="notation">
          <p>Understanding theme classes and writing custom HTML allowed me to make adjustments where needed to deliver the best display possible. In this instance, two columns were needed for list items in a single-column builder module</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Plugin integration</h2>
        <p>I helped Participate create a more robust contact form that integrates with SalesForce to push leads into relevant pipelines. This required me to do some research on how to write query strings that would push form data to an external database. With some testing, I was able to set up a web-to-lead stream that sent our sales team a steady flow of leads from the new website.</p>
        <div class="img-row">
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-string-01.png" alt="Gravity Forms web-to-lead string" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-form-01.png" alt="Gravity Forms form on participate.com" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="notation">
          <p>Additional fields were added to the form to send qualified leads to the sales team and funnel interested teachers to the recruitment team.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Subdomain setup</h2>
        <p>We set up a subdomain to move information previously in print to a more sustainable digital format.</p>
        <div class="img-row">
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-subdomain-01.png" alt="Subdomain support page" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/participate-subdomain-doc-01.png" alt="Subdomain documentation" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="notation">
          <p>Documentation outlining the 2-8-2 column effect I built on each page to reduce line length, since the team's Wordpress instance is heavily focused on text and legalese</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="VIF" class="tabcontent">
        <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/wordpress/wordpress-VIF-overview-01.png" alt="Desktop and mobile views of vifprogram.com" />
        <p>VIF International Education, now Participate, has been providing J 1 visas to cultural exchange teachers in the United States for more than 30 years. Prior to the company’s rebrand in 2017, I worked with the design team to manage the last iteration of vifprogram.com in Wordpress.</p>
        <h2>Start Your Journey</h2>
        <p>VIF’s “Start Your Journey” campaign featured travel-centric design elements, rustic textures and a focus on passport stamps to bring together the feeling of beginning a new journey in life to teach in the United States. We used serif fonts and the now popular Mellanie typeface to add some whimsy to the gravity of moving to a new country.</p>
        <p>I built on the design lead’s vision to provide new photo sections, page elements and infographics for the site as it grew.</p>
        <div class="img-row">
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="./resources/images/wordpress/vifprogram-team-01.png" alt="Teacher Resources team page view for vifprogram.com" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="notation">
          <p>The design theme focused on warm colors and the support of the team to provide the scaffolding for a strong experience</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Taking the reins</h2>
        <p>Managing vifprogram.com was my earliest experience working in a Wordpress dashboard. Prior to Wordpress, we used Joomla to manage the company’s web applications, so I had some baseline experience with page builders, plugins and dashboard management. Over time, I grew more confident building new pages, fine-tuning HTML and proposing new features for a better site experience.</p>
        <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/wordpress/vifprogram-notes-01.png" alt="Mockups and design flow ideation for vifprogram.com" />
        <div class="notation">
          <p>A proposed change for possible subnavigation designs. viflearn.com was a website managed by a different team whose design I wanted to follow somewhat for branding consistency.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Up until the company rebrand and a new website, vifprogram.com performed well as a maintainable website in an industry standard CMS, providing me the experience I would need to take on more responsibility with Participate.</p>
