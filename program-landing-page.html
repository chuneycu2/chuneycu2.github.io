      <p>I built a stand-alone webpage to serve as an intermediate for the companyâ€™s exchange teacher program as it transitioned its brand and assets during a company rebrand.</p>
      <p>The company's old website was no longer on-brand, and a new Wordpress theme was still under construction by a third party contractor. I was given a one-week timetable to design, build and test a webpage for the program while the new site was being set up.</p>
      <h2>Design and function</h2>
      <p>The goal of the landing page was to provide needed details to educators interested in applying to teach with the program. I began with sketches and layout, bringing together a wireframe that was more modern and vector-driven than designs in the previous brand.</p>
      <div class="img-row">
        <div class="img-block">
          <img src="./resources/images/microsite/wireframe_desktop-01.png" alt="Teach in the USA wireframe" />
        </div>
        <div class="img-block">
          <img src="./resources/images/microsite/mockup_desktop-01.png" alt="school locations pages" />
        </div>
      </div>
      </br>
      </br>
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>I knew that writing my own styles from scratch would take more time than I had. I tapped into W3.CSS and Bootstrap to set up a ready-to-use framework of responsive styles built with a focus on mobile displays, a key consideration for our audience. This gave me the tools I needed to flesh out a skeleton in HTML and set up responsive design for all of the content in the mockup I designed.</p>
      <h2>Bells and whistles</h2>
      <p>With my remaining time, I added jQuery to my anchors across the page to allow the page to scroll smoothly up or down, since the sub menu linked to sections throughout the page. I finished with hover states for the CTA buttons to give the page some basic interactivity.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The landing page served as an intermediate website until our new Wordpress instance was ready for build out. The webpage got more than 541,919 page views during this time.</p>
