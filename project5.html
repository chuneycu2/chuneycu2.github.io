    <p>The Cultural Exchange Teacher program landing page was my first opportunity to do full development work for VIF/Participate. Employing the skills I’d picked up in my time as a Design Producer, I built a stand-alone webpage to serve as an intermediate for the company’s exchange teacher program as it transitioned its brand and assets from VIF to Participate.</p>
    <h2>Company landing page</h2>
    <p>As VIF rebranded into Participate, there was a rough month at the beginning of 2018 where our old website was no longer on-brand and our new Wordpress theme was still under construction by a third party contractor. I was given a one-week timetable to design, build and test a webpage that would serve as a landing page for our exchange teacher program while the new site was being set up. This was a welcome test for the experience I had built up to this point!</p>
    <h2>Design and function</h2>
    <p>The goal of the landing page mimicked the user flow of the old site: provide needed details about the CET (Cultural Exchange Teacher) program and funnel interested teachers towards a link to apply. Coming off the heels of the rebrand in the last quarter of 2017, our new visual assets and typefaces were fresh on my mind. I began with sketches and layout, bringing together a wireframe that was more modern and vector-driven than designs in the previous VIF brand.</p>

      <p>Many proposed features did not make the final cut due to time and content changes midway through the project.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>With my experience at the time, I knew that writing my own styles from scratch would take more time than I had. I tapped into <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/" target="_blank">W3.CSS</a> to set up a ready-to-use framework of responsive styles built with a focus on mobile displays, a key consideration for our audience. This gave me the tools I needed to flesh out a skeleton in HTML and set up responsive columns for all of the content in the mockup.</p>
    <h2>Mockup vs reality</h2>
    <p>I learned quickly that it’s easy to design a pixel-perfect website in Adobe Illustrator, but sitting down to code the thing presents issues you can’t always foresee until you begin development.</p>
    <p>In some cases, photo choices didn’t scale the way I wanted them to when I resized the window, leading me to write more styles to account for separate use cases. W3 classes were useful for container setup, but I had to add floats and flex boxes (which I didn’t fully grasp yet) into some elements to achieve the display I wanted. For some areas, I resorted to inline styles to fine-tune for effects I wanted, most often by adding padding.</p>
    <h2>Bells and whistles</h2>
    <p>With my remaining time, I added jQuery to my anchors across the page to allow the page to scroll smoothly up or down, since the sub menu linked to sections throughout the page. I finished with hover states for the CTA buttons to give the page some basic interactivity.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I hosted the page in Pardot, our marketing automation service, which provided a space for a custom landing page and URL to be built without interfering with existing domain names. We set up a temporary redirect when the page was ready, and all existing vifprogram.com traffic was sent there.</p>
    <p>The landing page served well as an intermediate website until our new Wordpress instance was ready for build out. In the time it was active in the first quarter of 2018, the webpage got 541,919 page views per our records in Pardot!</p>

    <h2>Retrospect</h2>
    <p>It felt great to take control of design and development all on my own for the first time, and this section of my portfolio was one of the most enjoyable to document.</p>
    <p>A year after this project, I reviewed my code to see what I would change with new knowledge and experience I’ve gained. I have left my code as it was when I submitted the project to allow for an accurate assessment of my skills at the time, but here are a few changes I would make if I were to build this project in 2019:</p>
    <div class="indent">
      <ol>
        <li>Build mobile first. It’s easier to develop on desktop, but that shouldn’t make it the point of origin for design.</li>
        <li>W3.CSS was useful at the time, but unnecessary. I would rely more fully on flexbox and media queries for key breakpoints to build responsive containers that performed seamlessly at any device width</li>
        <li>Add semantic div elements for footer, nav, header and others for easier code review</li>
        <li>Streamline typographic styles from the onset to avoid having to make inline style declarations on the fly</li>
        <li>Add filters to photography for better legibility with text overlays</li>
        <li>Set a class for max widths on display containers for oversized displays, so photos set as background images don’t get cut off</li>
      </ol>
