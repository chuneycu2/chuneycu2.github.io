      <h1>Marketing email design</h1>
      <h4>HTML5, CSS, Responsive design</h4>

  <div class="content-container center">
    <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-overview-01.png" alt="Desktop and mobile views of the Participate newsletter" />
      <p>I have worked closely with Participate's marketing team as a design point person for my entire time at the company. This role involved writing email templates, testing layouts and creating new assets for events and campaigns.</p>
      <p>Participate's regular email newsletter is an ongoing design that I have been able to test and refine over time, and it represents most of what I have learned about building HTML emails.</p>
    <h2>Designing for web</h2>
      <p>My involvement with email HTML design began with updating existing templates in Marketo, the companyâ€™s marketing automation software of choice at the time. I was responsible for designing and optimizing visual assets for marketing campaigns, most often photo headers and vector icons.</p>
      <p>This early responsibility gave me the opportunity to familiarize myself with email HTML, which is built differently from static webpages through the use of nested tables and cells. I began to get my feet wet updating links, adjusting table cells and tweaking designs to achieve new effects.</p>

    <div class="notation">
      <p>Left: A standard VIF template. I designed an angled header image to prompt movement down through the email.<br>

    </div>
    <h2>A seat at the table</h2>
      <p>My responsibilities grew as roles changed and old designs became outdated. When the company rebranded in 2017, I had enough experience with email management to take on the task of creating a new design for our weekly newsletter. This process began with ideation and mockups.</p>
    <img class="hero flow-desktop" src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2017-mockup-01.png" alt="First full mockup for the Participate newsletter designed by yours truly" />
    <img class="hero flow-mobile" src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2017-mockup-mobile-01.png" alt="First full mockup for the Participate newsletter designed by yours truly" />
    <div class="notation">
      <p>With my first stab at the newsletter's new template, I began learning to balance the ease of creating a mockup with the considerations of a coded design that performs well</p>
    </div>
    <p>When I presented this mockup, it was well received. However, I had built it on the assumption that I would be able to code it the way I might code it on a static webpage with standard HTML. As I began development, I quickly learned two key paradigms about HTML email that made the task more difficult than I had anticipated:</p>
    <p>1. There are many more email clients than there are web browsers, and all of them have different compatibilities with common HTML elements.
      <br>
      <br>
    2. Table elements are the most reliably supported elements across all email clients, so they are used as the email-building standard.</p>
    <p>Additionally, my initial design was not as good as it could have been for mobile users. After testing a two-column model, I decided to streamline the design into a single-column layout that would scale across any device without the use of media queries.</p>
    <div class="img-row">
      <div class="img-block">
        <img src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2017-mockup-before.png" alt="First newsletter mockup" />
      </div>
      <div class="img-block">
        <img src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2017-mockup-after.png" alt="Second newsletter mockup" />
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class="notation">
    <p>Removing the two-column modules created a vertical flow that was designed to scale better on varying screen sizes</p>
  </div>
  <h2>The world is mobile</h2>
  <p>The template I built performed well for several months. Then the company hired a digital marketing manager who brought a lot of new expertise onboard, and together we began a research campaign to A/B test elements of the newsletter and how small changes performed against a control group.</p>
  <p>This opportunity allowed me to refine my design, most notably by learning how to implement responsive design techniques. Thanks to Litmus and other email marketing resources, I built a more robust template that performed even better across all kinds of devices. The newer template didn't rely too heavily on images to carry content, allowing stronger HTML to deliver scalable results.</p>
  <div class="img-row">
    <div class="img-block">
      <img src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2017-01.png" alt="First newsletter mockup" />
    </div>
    <div class="img-block">
      <img src="./resources/images/emails/newsletter-2018-01.png" alt="2018 responsive design" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notation">
    <p>The new design separated images and CTAs, preserving HTML content in case images broke or didn't load. Repeatable, responsive blocks could mix text and graphics interchangeably</p>
  </div>
  <p>We discovered some preferences among our readers:</p>
  <p>&bull; Vertical image/content modules performed better than multiple columns, as most of our readers were viewing the newsletter on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>&bull; Time of day the email is sent plays a large part in engagement, something we had not considered before.</p>
  <p>&bull; Free/downloadable content, perhaps unsurprisingly, boosts click-to-open rates.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notation">
    <p>Emails with downloadable content got a lot of attention. I designed these poster infographics for our Sustainable Development Goals series and bundled them into a printable PDF for <a href="./resources/images/emails/SDG9-posters.pdf">anyone to download</a></p>
  </div>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>The latest template performs so well, I set up variations of it for use by other departments in the company. I equipped one department, the Teacher Resources team, with a set of three templates and documentation so that they can send anything from basic announcements to newsletters of their own.</p>
  <p>Working with HTML emails has reinforced best practices for building any kind of web design. Chiefly, you must account for users and their email client limitations to deliver the best content possible to the most people possible. Design successful emails built not only strong experience in HTML, but a foundation in user-centered design principles that would inform my development work down the road.</p>
