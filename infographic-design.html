      <h1>Infographic design</h1>
      <h4>Adobe Illustrator</h4>
    </section>
    <section class="content-container center">
      <p>An infographic is my favorite way to capture information and tell a compelling visual story. I have created infographics on a variety of topics and for a variety of purposes, each within the context of its own brand or that of another organization. Below are selected favorites from throughout my career.</p>
      <h2>Benefits of a Bilingual Brain</h2>
      <p>My most popular and widely shared piece of work is an infographic called Benefits of a Bilingual Brain. I produced this infographic for VIF International Education's Splash program to promote bilingualism and dual language education in schools across the world.</p>
      <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/infographics/infographic-bilingual-brain-vif.png" alt="Bilingual Brain infographic in English" />
      <h3>Research and design</h3>
      <p>I researched bilingualism in a number of scholarly papers to verify what kind of benefits were quantifiable and suitable for representation. I studied existing diagrams on regions of the brain to create an accessible design for viewers to visually connect research with established science.</p>
      <p>When the company rebranded, I refined the infographic's design and worked with Spanish speakers on staff to produce an accompanying Spanish language version.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="img-block">

      <h2>Audi R8 infographic</h2>
      <p>I took a course on infographics that gave me a foundation in Illustrator and vector graphics. My vector recreation of the Audi R8 remains the highest testament to what I can achieve with a pen tool and gradients on an artboard.</p>
      <img class="hero" src="./resources/images/other/audi-R8-infographic.png" alt="Audi R8 infographic" />
      <p>The centerpiece of the graphic, a showroom view of the 2012 Audi R8, took me almost 15 hours of work producing vector components and color gradients. I traced a photograph and sampled its colors to produce line art for each section of the vehicle, moving up from the chassis into finer details.</p>

      <h2 id="heavy-skies">Heavy Skies</h2>
      <p>I worked as an associate designer for UNC's award-winning PoweringANation multimedia journalism project, 100 Gallons, producing supplementary design assets and infographics for the online experience.</p>
      <p>"Heavy Skies" explores the weight of water and the gravity of its motion through the water cycle throughout the planet.</p>

      </br>
      <h2>Cockfighting: History of a Blood Sport</h2>
      <p>I worked with another multimedia project at UNC, Living Galapagos, a series of stories from journalism students who studied abroad on the islands and brought their experiences together into a snapshot of Galapagos culture.</p>
      <p>I created an infographic about cockfighting on the islands, using data from the students' journey to provide a look at the blood sport and its tradition on the islands. Instead of relying too heavily on potentially sensitive photographs, I illustrated my own bird for the centerpiece and built the infographic around it.</p>

      </br>
      <h2>Kicking4Hunger</h2>
      <p>I volunteered to create an infographic of data from a colleague's non-profit foundation, Kicking4Hunger. I used his brand colors and data to create an overview of his organization. Kicking4Hunger accepts canned food as a fee for entry into soccer summer camps for kids across the country.</p>
